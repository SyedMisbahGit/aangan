# ðŸŒ¸ Aangan UX v2: Alive, Real, and Accessible (2025 Audit)

## âœ¨ 2025 Interaction Audit Summary

In July 2025, Aangan underwent a comprehensive interaction audit to ensure the experience is poetic, authentic, and fully accessible. The following changes were made:

### 1. Presence Data: Only Real, Never Fake
- All fake or random presence indicators were removed from the UI.
- Presence counts and poetic lines now only appear if real, live data is available from the backend or real-time context.
- This ensures the emotional atmosphere is honest and never artificially inflated.

### 2. Unified Onboarding: Poetic Welcome + Guide
- The separate intro modal and onboarding flow were merged into a single, seamless onboarding experience.
- The onboarding now begins with a poetic welcome, then gently guides the user through Aanganâ€™s features and values.
- Only one onboarding is shown per user, tracked by a single key.

### 3. Poetic Error & Empty States
- All error and empty state messages across Aangan were rewritten with poetic, gentle language.
- Users encountering errors or empty feeds are met with comforting, evocative lines that maintain the platformâ€™s emotional tone.

### 4. Full Keyboard Accessibility
- All interactive elements (navigation, forms, modals, carousels) have ARIA labels, visible focus rings, and logical tab order.
- The experience is fully navigable by keyboard, with clear focus indication and screen reader support.
