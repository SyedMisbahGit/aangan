In July 2025, Aangan underwent a comprehensive codebase audit and interaction review to ensure the platform is robust, maintainable, and provides an authentic, accessible experience. The following improvements were made:

### 1. Codebase Quality & Maintainability
- **Centralized Logging**: Replaced all console statements with a structured logging utility for better debugging and monitoring.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript errors and improved type definitions across the codebase.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling patterns with proper error boundaries and user-friendly messages.
- **Code Organization**: Improved file structure and naming conventions for better maintainability.

### 2. Security & Authentication
- **JWT Verification**: Implemented comprehensive JWT verification middleware with role-based access control.
- **Service Worker Security**: Enhanced service worker implementation for better security and reliability.
- **Input Validation**: Strengthened input validation across all API endpoints.

### 3. Real-time Experience

- **Connection Management**: Enhanced reconnection logic and error handling for WebSocket connections.
- **State Synchronization**: Ensured consistent state across real-time updates and page refreshes.

### 4. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Improved ARIA attributes and semantic HTML structure.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile and desktop UI consistency across different screen sizes.

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented code splitting and lazy loading for better initial load performance.
- **Bundle Size**: Reduced JavaScript bundle size through tree-shaking and optimization.
- **Rendering Performance**: Optimized React component rendering for smoother interactions.

### 6. Presence Data: Only Real, Never Fake
- All fake or random presence indicators were removed from the UI.
- Presence counts and poetic lines now only appear if real, live data is available from the backend or real-time context.
- This ensures the emotional atmosphere is honest and never artificially inflated.

### 7. Unified Onboarding: Poetic Welcome + Guide
### 2. Unified Onboarding: Poetic Welcome + Guide
- The separate intro modal and onboarding flow were merged into a single, seamless onboarding experience.

- Only one onboarding is shown per user, tracked by a single key.

### 3. Poetic Error & Empty States
- All error and empty state messages across Aangan were rewritten with poetic, gentle language.
- Users encountering errors or empty feeds are met with comforting, evocative lines that maintain the platformâ€™s emotional tone.

### 4. Full Keyboard Accessibility
- All interactive elements (navigation, forms, modals, carousels) have ARIA labels, visible focus rings, and logical tab order.
- The experience is fully navigable by keyboard, with clear focus indication and screen reader support.
