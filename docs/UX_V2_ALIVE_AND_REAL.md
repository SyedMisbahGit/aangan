## 2025-07 Full App Optimization & UX Audit: Key Takeaways

- All main pages and flows were audited for functionality, performance, accessibility, and UX.
- Most flows are modular, animated, and accessible, but some subcomponents need improved async state handling (loading/error/empty states).
- Some links (e.g., /settings) are dead-ends and should be removed or implemented.
- Dark mode and accessibility should be verified app-wide, especially for modals and charts.
- Replace demo/static data with real API calls in production.
- Add a custom /500 error page for server errors.
- See PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md for technical best practices and audit-driven recommendations.

This audit supports the v2.0 "Alive & Real" UX goals: emotional clarity, accessibility, and a seamless, real human presence throughout the app.
