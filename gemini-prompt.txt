You are now working on a poetic, emotion-aware, campus-rooted social app called "Aangan," designed for students at Central University of Jammu (CUJ). The app is built using React (TypeScript + Vite), TailwindCSS, and Express backend with SQLite or PostgreSQL. It is deployed as a PWA and accessible via browser and mobile. 

Your goal is to now **create version v1.8**, focused on grounding Aangan in real campus context and improving the emotional usability of the app.

üîß Tasks for this version:
1. **CUJ Campus Personalization**
   - Introduce a lightweight onboarding flow for new users where they choose/confirm:
     - Which CUJ location they're near (e.g., Tapri, Library, Hostel)
     - How they feel (emotion from emotion palette)
     - Optionally, a poetic nickname
   - Save this in localStorage for anonymous session memory

2. **Context-Aware Whisper Suggestions**
   - Show context-aware poetic prompts based on location and emotion during whisper composition.
   - Example: "You sit at Tapri, heart humming with nostalgia üçµ ‚Äî want to whisper something?"

3. **Fix these UX issues from user feedback**
   - Fix floating + button visibility bug where font isn't visible when typing.
   - Esc showing on Listen icon ‚Äî remove it.
   - Add a global back button on top left of each main screen for smoother navigation.
   - Make sure whisper composer opens reliably, and input text is visible clearly.

4. **Add a minimal Whisper Archive**
   - Create a new section in "My Corner" ‚Üí "Archive"
   - Let user see past whispers (stored in localStorage or indexedDB for now).
   - Show title line, time, and location of whisper.

üí° Design Philosophy Reminder:
- App feels like a courtyard, not a feed.
- Remove metrics, show poetic presence instead.
- All labels and metaphors should be emotionally soft and grounded in shared feeling.

Please write optimized React (TSX) + Tailwind + backend (Express+SQLite) code changes and file edits as needed. Generate only the code needed for this version update. If file structure needs to be changed, specify it clearly.
