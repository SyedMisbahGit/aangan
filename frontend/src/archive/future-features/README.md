# Archived Future Features

This directory contains components that were developed for potential future features but are not currently in use in the main application. These components are kept here for potential future use or reference.

## Contents

### WhisperMilestones.tsx
A component that was intended to track and display user milestones within the application. This feature was partially implemented but put on hold pending further design decisions.

### WhisperMurmurs.tsx
An experimental feature that would have allowed for more subtle, ambient communication between users. This was an exploration of alternative interaction patterns.

### WhisperRituals.tsx
A component for scheduled or recurring whisper events. This feature was planned but deprioritized in favor of other functionality.

### WhisperShrines.tsx
A concept for user-created collections or themed spaces. This was an experimental feature that may be revisited in the future.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

These components are archived rather than deleted because:
1. They represent significant development effort that might be useful in the future
2. They contain patterns or implementations that could inform future features
3. They might be revived if priorities change

## How to Use These Components

If you want to revive any of these components:
1. Move the component file back to the appropriate location in `src/components/whisper/`
2. Update any dependencies or imports as needed
3. Add the component to the main export in `src/components/index.ts`
4. Update any relevant documentation
5. Add or update tests as needed

## Contributing

If you're interested in working on any of these features, please discuss it with the team first to ensure it aligns with the current product direction.
