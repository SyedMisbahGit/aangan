## Executive Summary
- Infrastructure: ✅ Provisioned and validated
- Blue-Green Deployment: ✅ Tested and verified  
- Chaos Engineering: ✅ All scenarios passed
- Stress Testing: ✅ Performance validated
- Monitoring: ✅ SLO/SLI configured

## Test Results Summary
- Maximum Error Rate: < 10% during chaos scenarios ✅
- Recovery Time: < 30 seconds for all failures ✅
- Latency: 95th percentile < 2 seconds ✅
- Scaling: Handles 200+ concurrent users ✅

## Go/No-Go Checklist
- [ ] Infrastructure deployed and stable
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Chaos testing passed
- [ ] Stress testing passed
- [ ] Database backup strategy confirmed
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team trained on incident response

## Launch Approval
- [ ] Technical Lead Approval: ________________
- [ ] Product Owner Approval: ________________  
- [ ] Infrastructure Lead Approval: ________________
- [ ] Security Review Complete: ________________

## Launch Timeline Confirmation
- Week 3 Day 3 (Launch Day): $(Get-Date (Get-Date).AddDays(7) -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')
- Go-Live Time: 09:00 AM
- Traffic Ramp: 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100% over 3 hours
