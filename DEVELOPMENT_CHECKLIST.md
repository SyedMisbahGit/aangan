# üìã Development Checklist - Aangan Platform

## üéØ Core Principles
- **Simple**: Keep code clean, readable, and maintainable
- **Secure**: Follow security best practices at all times
- **Sustainable**: Build for long-term maintainability and performance

## üöÄ Before Starting Development

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Node.js v18+ installed
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured (`backend/.env`)
- [ ] Database migrations run (`npm run migrate`)
- [ ] Development server starts without errors (`npm run dev`)

### Code Quality Tools
- [ ] ESLint configured and passing (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed (`npm run prepare`)

## üîß During Development

### Code Standards
- [ ] Follow existing code style and patterns
- [ ] Use TypeScript for all new code
- [ ] Write meaningful commit messages (conventional commits)
- [ ] Keep functions small and focused
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Security Practices
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (no SQL injection)
- [ ] Implement proper authentication/authorization
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] Never commit secrets or sensitive data

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Lazy load components when possible
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Minimize bundle size
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement proper caching strategies

## üß™ Before Committing

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] All linting errors fixed (`npm run lint:fix`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] All tests passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] Test coverage maintained (80%+)
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code

### Security Checks
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization working
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] CORS settings appropriate

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Bundle size within limits
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Responsive design working
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Error boundaries in place

## üöÄ Before Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Security audit clean (`npm run test:security`)
- [ ] Performance audit passing (`npm run test:performance`)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] SSL certificates valid
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configured

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Health checks working
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üîÑ Regular Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Run security audit (`npm run maintenance:security`)
- [ ] Check for dependency updates (`npm run maintenance:update`)
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Update documentation

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Full maintenance check (`npm run maintenance`)
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Security assessment
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Code quality audit

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive security review
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Architecture review
- [ ] Technical debt assessment
- [ ] Team training and knowledge sharing

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                    # Start development server
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run preview               # Preview production build
npm run lint                  # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix              # Fix linting issues
npm run test                  # Run tests
npm run test:coverage         # Run tests with coverage
```

### Maintenance
```bash
npm run maintenance           # Full maintenance check
npm run maintenance:security  # Security checks only
npm run maintenance:performance # Performance checks only
npm run maintenance:quality   # Code quality checks only
npm run maintenance:cleanup   # Clean build artifacts
npm run maintenance:update    # Update dependencies
```

### Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze               # Analyze bundle size
npm run typecheck             # TypeScript compilation check
npm run test:security         # Security audit
npm run test:performance      # Performance audit
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures
