- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data is not exposed in responses

### Dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Only necessary dependencies are included

## Dependency Updates

1. **Check for updates**
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npx npm-check-updates

   # Backend
   cd ../backend
   npx npm-check-updates
   ```

2. **Update dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Update package.json
   npx npm-check-updates -u

   # Install updates
   npm install

   # Test the application
   npm test
   ```

3. **Review changelogs** for breaking changes

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backups
```bash
# Daily backup (run via cron)
pg_dump -U username -d dbname -f /backups/college-whisper-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Compress old backups
find /backups -name "*.sql" -mtime +7 -exec gzip {} \;

# Remove backups older than 30 days
find /backups -name "*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### File Backups
```bash
# Backup uploads directory
tar -czvf /backups/uploads-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /path/to/uploads

# Sync to remote storage
aws s3 cp /backups/uploads-*.tar.gz s3://your-bucket/backups/
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Server CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Database connection pool usage
- API response times
- Error rates
- Authentication failures
- Rate limit hits

### Alert Thresholds
- CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
- Memory > 90% usage
- Disk space < 10% free
- API error rate > 1%
- 5xx errors > 0
- Authentication failures > 10 per minute

## Documentation Review

### Review and Update:
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] README files
- [ ] Code comments
- [ ] Changelog

### Documentation Locations
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `API.md` - API reference
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions
- `MAINTENANCE.md` - This maintenance guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes

## Incident Response

### Reporting an Issue
1. Document the issue with:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages
   - Environment details
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

2. Assign priority:
   - P0: Critical (system down, security issue)
   - P1: High (major functionality broken)
   - P2: Medium (minor issue, workaround exists)
   - P3: Low (cosmetic, enhancement)

### Resolution Process
1. Acknowledge the issue
2. Investigate and diagnose
3. Implement a fix
4. Test the fix
5. Deploy the fix
6. Verify the resolution
7. Document the solution

## Performance Monitoring
